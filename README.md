# docker-gRPC-go
Working with windows is a PITA, this container makes it a little less shit to work on windows with gRPC and GO until microsoft decides to join us in 2015

## gRPC Dockerfile
This is a golang docker image with gRPC compiled into it. Its main use is to generate the go files files from proto3 proto files.

## Usage
Just build the docker image or run it from docker hub at:

    docker pull kynrai/docker-grpc-go
